# gpxviz

This project documents my learning experience with the following three topics:

1. organizing a package to share with others, resolve dependencies, and ultimately share the package on PyPI,
2. creating a desktop and a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), and
3. working with plotly and MapBox to plot beautiful maps.

This is a project under construction aimed at analyzing a single gpx track file for endurance athletes to nerd over. The **three main goals** of this project are:
- Plot the track on a topo map (or street map),
- Calculate "Basic Statistics" about the gpx track, and 
- Flexibly analyze various parameters, e.g. heart rate vs speed or heart rate vs. inclination.

The project will be **implemented** with a **web-based** and **browser-based** GUI and I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each tool.
